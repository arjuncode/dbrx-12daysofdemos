### 📬 The Challenge
Every year, Santa receives **millions of letters** from children around the world. The old system of manually reading and categorizing each letter simply can't keep up with modern demand!

### ✨ The Solution: Databricks AI Functions
The North Pole Modernization Office (NPMO) has deployed **Databricks AI Functions** to automatically:
* 🎯 **`ai_classify()`** - Categorize behavior (Naughty or Nice) and route gifts to workshop departments
* 💪 **`ai_extract()`** - Pull out top priority gifts and good deeds claimed
* 🎄 **`ai_analyze_sentiment()`** - Measure Christmas spirit and excitement levels
* ✉️ **`ai_gen()`** - Generate personalized responses from Santa
* 🌍 **`ai_translate()`** - Convert letters for international elves
* 📊 **`ai_summarize()`** - Create daily briefings for Mrs. Claus
* 🚀 **`ai_query()`** - Use Claude Sonnet 4 for advanced multi-dimensional classification with structured JSON output

### 🎓 What You'll Learn
This notebook shows you how to use **Databricks AI Functions**, powerful built-in AI capabilities that let you analyze text data using simple SQL. No ML expertise, model training, or complex infrastructure needed!

**Key concepts covered:**
- Calling AI functions directly in SQL queries
- Processing text data at scale on Delta Lake tables
- Using structured JSON schemas with `ai_query()` for reliable, parseable results
- Parsing AI output into queryable database columns

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** into your Databricks workspace
2. **Update the configuration** in Cell 2 with your catalog and schema names
3. **Run all cells** to see AI functions in action

**No prior Databricks experience needed!** Just follow along as we help Santa modernize his operations.

### 💡 Real-World Applications
The same patterns work for:
- **Customer Support** - Classify tickets, extract issues, generate responses
- **Content Moderation** - Analyze sentiment, detect policy violations  
- **Document Processing** - Summarize reports, extract key information
- **Compliance** - Extract entities, classify document types
