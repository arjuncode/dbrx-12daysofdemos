**💡 Tips for Better Results**

1. **Be specific** - "letters from Ontario" works better than "Ontario stuff"
2. **Use column names** - Reference "gifts" or "province" directly
3. **Start simple** - Begin with basic counts before complex analysis
4. **Iterate** - Ask follow-up questions to drill down into results
