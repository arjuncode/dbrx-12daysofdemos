# 🎄 12 Days of Demos: How Santa Uses Databricks

**A holiday journey through the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform.**

The holidays bring joy, but they also bring operational pressure: surging demand, shifting behavior, and the need for fast decisions. Whether you run a polar toy factory or a global enterprise, the truth remains: **Organizations thrive when their data, analytics, AI, and operations work seamlessly together.**

## 🎅 The North Pole Modernization Office (NPMO)

With guidance from Santa, the **NPMO** was established to migrate away from manual spreadsheets and scattered data into an automated, AI-first data platform.

> **The Goal:** Deliver the right gifts, to the right children, on time, with the best customer satisfaction in holiday history.

To realize this vision, we are unifying the entire North Pole operation on the **Databricks Lakehouse**. Over the next 12 days, we will build a complete solution—from ingestion to multi-agent AI systems.
